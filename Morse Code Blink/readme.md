# Circuit Description
  Attach a 220ohm resistor from the voltage out pin to the positive end of an LED. Attach the cathode to pin 11.
# Code Description
  Type in a string without any special characters (including commas, apostrophes, etc) and press enter to have the LED blink the code
  
# Areas for improvement
  Enable support for additional characters (even if they're not outputted as morse)
  Clean up the code
  Separate the input code from the setup function and have the string loaded in a more appropriate manner
