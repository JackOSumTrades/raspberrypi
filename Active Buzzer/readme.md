# Circuit Description
- An NPN ttransister (S8050) is used to increase the current provided to the active buzzer
- a 1kOhm resistor is used in series to the gate of the transistor

# Notes
- Current code makes the buzzer sound like a fire alarm

# Code Description
- Just code to make the buzzer alarm
